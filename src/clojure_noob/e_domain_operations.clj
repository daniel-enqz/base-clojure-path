;; About Side Effects
;; Sometimes, the initialization of an entity must include unavoidable side-effects, such as I/O or network access.
;; Including the side-effects in the constructor isolates them from the rest of the code.
;; In this code we are printing the transaction to the console, which is a side-effect. But it is isolated in the audit-transaction function.
