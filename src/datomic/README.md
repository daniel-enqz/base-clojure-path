## Storage:

- Purpose: Durable data persistence
- Structure: Data organized in segments containing many datoms
- Options: Various backends (e.g., DynamoDB, with optional caching like Memcached)
- Key feature: Retrieves entire segments, not individual datoms

## Transactor:

- Purpose: Central coordinator of the database
- Main functions:
  - Processes transactions serially
  - Validates and commits changes
  - Maintains database consistency
  - Writes to the log

_Communicates with: Peers and Storage_

## Peers:

- Purpose: Database interface close to the application
- Main functions:
  - Sends transactions to Transactor
  - Executes queries locally
  - Caches data
  - Fetches data from Storage when needed

_Communicates with: Application, Transactor, and Storage_
